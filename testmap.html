                <p>After the publication of his narrative in 1845, William Lloyd Garrison was concerned Douglassâ€™ former master would try and reclaim him, and urged him to travel to Britain for safety.</p>

                <p>It was an opportunity for Douglass and the abolitionists to spread awareness of the cruelties of American slavery and through this, gather an international reputation.</p>

                <p>When Douglass arrived in Britain in 1845, he visited those towns where antislavery support was strongest, and friends of the cause would usually meet him at a train station or instruct him where to meet and whom to stay with.</p>
