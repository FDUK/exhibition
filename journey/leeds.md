The extensive lecturing tour in Britain physically exhausted Douglass. He would occasionally speak twice a day: once in the morning or in the early afternoon to a ladies antislavery society, and then hold a meeting in the evening. Starting between 7-8pm, the meeting would finish roughly between 11pm and midnight, with Douglass speaking up to two or three hours. This gruelling schedule finally took its toll in December 1846, when Douglass was forced to cancel a series of lectures in Leeds before Christmas. On the 26th, he held a meeting in the local Music Hall in Leeds but evidently was still suffering from exhaustion. 

>I want you in your churches – Methodist, Baptist, Congregationalist, all persuasions – to declare in your conventions, associations, synods, conferences no fellowship with slaveholders. I want the slaveholder surrounded, as by a wall of anti-slavery fire, so that he may see the condemnation of himself and his system glaring down in letters of light…I would have condemnation blaze down upon him in every direction, till, stunned and overwhelmed with shame and confusion, he is compelled to let go the grasp he holds upon the persons of his victims, and restore them to their long-lost rights. Mr Douglass’ strength failed him. He was compelled to resume his seat, requesting that some one might address the meeting until he had in some measure recovered.
