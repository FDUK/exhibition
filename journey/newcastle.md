In nearly every lecture, Douglass had to define what slavery was to a British audience. Britons did not (and would never) understand the cruelty and violence of a system that could not be described. Many Britons believed slavery existed in their country, in the factories and mills of the north where men, women and children suffered under harsh conditions. Douglass wanted to prove that slavery did not exist in Britain, and it was an entirely different beast in America:

“What is American slavery? It is not the relation in which a great mass of the people are compelled to labour and toil almost beyond their endurance – that is not slavery. I have laboured as hard in a state of freedom as ever I did in a state of slavery. It is not slavery to be restricted in point of political privileges – if that were so, all women would be slaves. It is not slavery to be compelled to labour against our own will. The slavery of the United States is that relation by which one man claims and enforces the right of property in the body and soul of another man. It is that relation by which one man without contract, without compensation, without consultation with the individual, reduces him to the condition of a beast of burden. [Slaves are] reduced to the condition of marketable commodities, exposed to be sold on the auction block, just as horses, sheep and swine are sold in the market, on the same level, held by the same tenure, spoken of, thought of, treated, in every way as property. This is slavery – having a mind, he may not cultivate and improve it; having a soul, he may not call it his own; having a soul he may not call it his own, having moral appreciations, he may not be guided by them; having a conscience, he may not walk by its admonitions; having an immortal spirit and a soul to aspire, he may not aspire, humbly as his Master did…”(Newcastle Guardian, August 8 1846, p.2)
