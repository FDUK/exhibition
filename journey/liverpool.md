In the spring of 1847, Douglass prepared to leave Britain and between February and April, farewell meetings were held in numerous cities to thank Douglass for campaigning against American slavery. When Douglass eventually boarded the Cunard steamship Cambria in 1847 with a first class ticket, he was refused entry and found that his berth had been given to someone else. Douglass wrote a letter to the press denouncing this racist treatment, and they responded just as Douglass expected they would: with outrage. The incident was discussed hundreds of times across the country, even in places where Douglass had never visited. The controversy reached such a height that Samuel Cunard – the owner of the steamship company – was forced to publicly apologise in the press.

The Cambria incident also inspired poems and songs, which illustrate this theme of British patriotism very well. The Leicestershire Mercury printed a ‘Farewell Song to Frederick Douglass’ by T. Powis Griffiths in July 1847: 

Farewell to the land of the free!  
Farewell to the land of the brave!  
Alas! That my country should be  
America, land of the slave!  

Am I not wanted where warfare is waging?  
Shall I, like a coward, not join in the fight?  
Bring from the onslaught when battle is raging,  
Scared by the enemy’s tyrannous might?

In the wake of Douglass’ visit, British abolitionists and supporters raised over £450 to enable him to buy a printing press and organise a newspaper, which eventually became the North Star.
