title: "“SEND BACK THE MONEY!” Dundee"
---

Douglass created a storm of controversy in Scotland. Two years before his arrival, in 1843 the Free Church of Scotland was formed and ministers travelled to the United States to raise money for their new organisation. Some donations came from slaveholders in the South, much to the chagrin of abolitionists who mocked the Church for its “Free” status despite receiving money directly made from the enslavement of men, women and children. Douglass used the slogan ‘SEND BACK THE MONEY’ to win support amongst the Scottish people, and gave several lectures in major towns such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paisley, Dundee and Aberdeen. Douglass’s campaign led to Scottish churches questioning whether they should remain friendly with American churches who refused to denounce slavery. Although the money was never returned, Douglass became a celebrity in Scotland: songs and poems were written about his visit, and thousands of people came to hear him speak.

In early spring 1846, the desire to see Douglass was so great that 1,200 people crammed themselves into a chapel in Dundee to hear lectures on the relationship of Scottish churches with American slavery. Douglass denounced the Free Church of Scotland and demanded the money be returned:

>Disgorge the plunder! Disgorge the plunder! The cry shall be heard throughout Scotland. I shall not be silenced by an attempt to make light of it. I shall not be hushed by an attempt to excite ridicule – or an attempt to stand up before the world and blacken my character by their base insinuations. I defy them to point to a single black spot in my character.
