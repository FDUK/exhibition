Douglass praised Britain for its antislavery sentiment and declared it was the first place where he felt truly free. In one meeting in Leicester, the lecturing hall was overflowing with people, and hundreds had to leave disappointed when they could not find a space. Douglass declared:

>He had heard of a land where he might be free, and that England was that land: here therefore embraced the first opportunity which presented itself, and came over here. He was prepared for a kind and generous reception at the hands of the British public, but he must say that the reception he had everywhere met with, from his first landing eighteen months ago, had been more kind, more benevolent and more enthusiastic, than his warmest hopes had led him to anticipate. Never, indeed, from the moment he had landed on British soil, had he met with a single person, boasting the name of a Briton, who had given the slightest cause for suspecting that he disliked him because god had given him a different coloured skin.
