In one of his final lectures in England, Douglass travelled to the midlands to give a speech in Northampton. The local press reported that his lecture “was of exceeding length and interest” and brought many audience members to tears. 

>His figure is commanding, his eyes and entire countenance animated and expressive, his voice at once sonorous and musical; and with perfect self-possession he unites equal modesty of manner… He was grateful, he continued, to Englishmen – he loved England and he had been offered the means of remaining here, but this could not be, as he had work to do in America. We left crowds hurrying to the platform to get a good look at, or shake hands with the gifted and intrepid enemy of slavery.
