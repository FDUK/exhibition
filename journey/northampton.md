Douglass was such a skilled speaker he could bring an audience to tears.

In one of his final lectures in England, Douglass travelled to the midlands to give a speech in Northampton. The local press reported that his lecture “was of exceeding length and interest” and the audience laughed, gasped and cried throughout his speech.

>His figure is commanding, his eyes and entire countenance animated and expressive, his voice at once sonorous and musical; and with perfect self-possession he unites equal modesty of manner…We left crowds hurrying to the platform to get a good look at, or shake hands with the gifted and intrepid enemy of slavery.
