British abolitionists purchased Douglass' freedom, and he returned to the US a (legally) free man.

 Douglass was forever grateful to the British abolitionists for this, despite the fact it caused ripples of disagreements with some of William Lloyd Garrison’s supporters, who believed purchasing an individual from slavery added further blood stained money to the pockets of slaveholders. In his last meeting in London, Douglass described why he had rejected offers to live in Britain permanently, as he could not abandon his fellow brethren in slavery:

>I came a slave, I go back free, I came here despised, I go back with reputation...I prefer to live a life of activity – I prefer to go home, to go to America. I glory in the conflict, that I may also glory in the victory…I will tell my coloured countrymen how Englishmen feel for them. It will be something to give them patience under their sorrows and hope of a future emancipation.
