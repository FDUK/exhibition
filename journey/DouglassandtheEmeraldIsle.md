Ireland was to be Frederick Douglass’ first stop on his tour of Britain. He travelled from Liverpool and stayed with abolitionists across the country, visiting the major cities of Belfast, Dublin, and Limerick, as well as visiting the Giants Causeway in the north. Douglass was very popular in Ireland. He established links with the Hibernian Anti-Slavery Society, founded in 1837 by Richard Davis Webb and James Haughton. Like Garrison in America, they wanted slavery to be abolished immediately, as opposed to some British societies like the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery society, who favoured a gradual route to abolition. Douglass frequently shared a speaking platform with Daniel O’Connell, the Irish ‘Liberator’ and supporter of Catholic rights in Parliament (see below for a short biography). O’Connell called Douglass the “black O’Connell”, firmly establishing an antislavery connection between the two men. O’Connell’s speeches were often found in The Liberator.[^1]

The Irish could identify with Douglass’ call for freedom – in their eyes, the British government had oppressed them for centuries. Douglass appealed to the notion of liberty for all, regardless of class, race or nationality – thus, slavery and oppression must be abolished.[^2] In a letter to Garrison in September 1845, Douglas praised O’Connell for his anti-slavery beliefs, describing one of his speeches:

“Upon the subject of slavery in general and American slavery in particular, Mr O’Connell grew warm and energetic…he said with an earnestness which I shall never forget ‘I have been assailed for attacking [slavery]. I am not ashamed of that attack
Daniel O'Connell, 1847, Library of Congress…I am the foe of the tyrant…wherever slavery rears its head, I am the enemy of the system, or the institution, call it by what you will. I am the friend of liberty…my sympathy with distress is not confined within the narrow bounds of my own green island.” (Frederick Douglass, letter to William Lloyd Garrison, September 29 1845.)

As a result of this popularity, hundreds came to hear Douglass speak, and he published a new version of his Narrative highlighting the strength of Irish support. Douglass found that, unlike parts of America, few areas were closed to him in Ireland – he dined with upper class gentlemen intrigued to hear his story, and travelled across the country without restriction. He even dined with the Lord Mayor of Dublin! Douglass was impressed by the beauty of Ireland, and spoke frequently of the kindness he received from friends. But, he also wrote of the horror he felt when he witnessed the dire poverty of the Irish people.[^3]

Some Irishmen, however, were not impressed with Douglass’ celebrity – on several occasions in Belfast, graffiti covered the advertisements of his speeches, demanding he be sent back to America. This was scarcely written about in Douglass’ writing, for he wanted to create a strong contrast to the United States. The United Kingdom was a land of freedom, the United States was not.[^4]

There is a mural depicting Douglass in Belfast, a tribute to his experiences in Ireland and his sympathy for Irish oppression. (Above.) 

Daniel O’Connell
----------------

Daniel O’Connell is one of the most famous politicians in Ireland. He was born in August 1775 to a wealthy, Catholic family, yet this Catholicism prevented him from the status and authority he could have gained if he was a Protestant. O’Connell first trained as a lawyer, but after reading the works of Thomas Paine and Jeremy Bentham, he was convinced that politics was his calling. O’Connell was a radical for the time – he supported democracy and the freedom of religion, something which his conservative colleagues despised him for. In Ireland, he became committed to the cause of Irish freedom from British rule, but rejected the use of violence or rebellion – he wanted to achieve freedom through pDaniel O'Connell, 1836.olitical means. He never lost sight of this goal, despite returning to practice law for over a decade. He continued to support religious freedom, arguing that Catholics should be given the same rights as Protestants, including the right of Catholic politicians to sit in the House of Commons, something which had always been denied to them. O’Connell became the frontrunner for this Catholic Emancipation crusade, and fought for the end of British rule in Ireland, votes for men and women and the secret ballot. O’Connell told the British government that the Irish were ready to revolt over the issue of Catholic Emancipation, although he would not support the violence himself. O’Connell won a local election in County Clare but was prevented from going to the Commons because he was a Catholic. Politicians such as Sir Robert Peel, the Duke of Welington and Joseph Hume supported O’Connell’s cause, arguing that unrest in Ireland would only increase if Catholic Emancipation was not granted. In 1829, the Catholic Emancipation Act was passed, finally allowing Catholics into the House of Commons. O’Connell continued to support reform, focusing on prisons, the law, free trade, suffrage and the abolition of slavery. In 1841, he served as the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the first Catholic to do so. He continued to support the abolition of the Act of Union, demanding that Ireland should be free from the British, and was even threatened with a prison sentence for treason. This only made him more popular however, as he became a symbol of free speech. His campaign failed to convince the government, and the Act of Union was not repealed. During his travels around Europe in 1847, O’Connell died in Genoa. In his will, he requested that his heart be buried in Rome, his body in Ireland. Nicknamed “The Liberator, O’Connell was a champion of reform and free speech, and influenced activists across the world including Douglass, Martin Luther King and Mahatma Ghandi. [^5]
