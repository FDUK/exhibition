Douglass was extremely successful in Bristol. He lectured in the city several times because a local antislavery family there – the Estlin family – were friendly with William Lloyd Garrison. The Estlin family ensured the local press printed adverts and long coverage of Douglass’ speeches, often taking up pages of The Bristol Mercury: 

>Frederick Douglass is no common man. His language is plain and to the purpose. His manner though not deficient in energy is on the whole quiet and subdued, and yet there are occasional tones in his voice – not unlike the low growl of the lion which hint at ‘something dangerous’ and would seem to indicate that he is a man not to be trampled on with impunity.

### Independence Day

Douglass spoke of the same themes he would famously articulate in his “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July” speech in 1852:

>Their declaration put forth that all men were born free and were equally entitled to certain inalienable rights – to life and liberty in the pursuit of happiness that all just governments derived their right to govern from the people – and yet under the very eave-droppings of their political institutions – under the very eave-droppings of their chapels were heard the clank of the fetters and the rattling of the chains which bound their miserable slaves together to be driven by the lash of their driver on board the ships for New Orleans there to be sold in the market-like brutes.
