Douglass was popular in the industrial north of England.

He gave many lectures in the north of England in manufacturing towns such as Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds. The wealth of such towns was based on importing slave-grown cotton from the American South, but the large majority of Britons supported the antislavery cause and thus came to hear Douglass speak in their thousands. One newspaper described Douglass as a “Negro Hercules” and “the effect produced by his oratory must be seen to be believed.” (The Manchester Examiner, Saturday 11 July 1846, p.5.)

However, Douglass also created controversy in Britain for his condemnation of American churches who refused to denounce slavery. In October 1846, Douglass held a meeting in Manchester but they were “numbers of persons who were tired out” with his lecture and promptly left the meeting in disgust. After Douglass’ speech, an African stood up in agreement with Douglass about the horrific treatment of enslaved individuals, but:

>The lateness of the hour, and the impossibility to the great body of the meeting, of hearing or understanding the last speaker, again caused great crowds to withdraw.
