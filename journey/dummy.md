Douglass began his lecturing tour in Ireland. 

In one meeting in Belfast, the local mayor chaired the meeting and introduced Douglass to an enthusiastic crowd. Douglass described his birthplace in Maryland and believed he had authority to speak about slavery, as 

>he had writhed under the lash of the tyrant
{:.big}

However, Douglass caused some controversy during his second visit to Belfast six months later, and the presence of the radical abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison did not improve matters. Both men denounced religious institutions in Britain and America who refused to condemn slavery, angering many people in the city. One newspaper wrote:

>People who speak so very much of themselves and so very little of the ostensible object of their mission are either fools or imposters, and sometimes we doubt not, they are a little of both.

Douglass was described in racist terms as “the ‘curled darling’ of the ladies” and was accused of stirring up hatred against the church:


>There was a second mournful exhibition of bad taste and worse feeling, on the part of the abolition agitators in which the chief actor was Mr F. Douglass. We shall not characterise the language made use of on this occasion as it deserves. It is sufficient to record that it has totally defeated its real or pretended object – if that object be the strengthening of the cause of anti-slavery.
