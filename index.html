                <h2>Frederick Douglass</h2>
                
                <p>Frederick Douglass became an national celebrity in Britain in 1845.</p> 
                
                After the publication of his narrative in 1845, William Lloyd Garrison was concerned Douglassâ€™ former master would try and reclaim him, and urged him to travel to Britain for safety</p>
                <p>It was an opportunity for Douglass and the abolitionists to spread awareness of the cruelties of American slavery and through this, gather an international reputation.</p>

                <p>When Douglass arrived in Britain in 1845, he visited those towns where antislavery support was strongest, and friends of the cause would usually meet him at a train station or write to Douglass directly instructing him where to meet and whom to stay with.</p>
